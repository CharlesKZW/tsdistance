<!-- Short description -->
<p align="center">
  tsdistance is a comprehensive  open-source library for time series distance measures, which can be used in various time series machine learning tasks (classification, clustering, motif discovery, etc.)
</p>

## Notice on Installation
This is **alpha software under development** and currently the best way to use is to download the repo and import distance functions needed. We will upload it to platforms like PyPI soon.

## Getting started

### 1. Getting the data in the right format
tsdistance expects a time series to be formatted as a 1D `numpy` array. Distance measures in `tsdistance.elastic` can take in time series of different length as input, while distance measures in other sections expect input time series to have equal length. 

```python3
>>> from tsdistance.elastic import lcss
>>> import numpy as np
>>> X = np.array([3, 4, 38, 4, 5])
>>> Y = np.array([0, 3, 4])
>>> lcss_dist = lcss(X, Y, epsilon = 0.7)
>>> lcss_dist

>>> 0.33333333333333337
```


### 2. Training a model

After getting the data in the right format, a model can be trained. `tsdistance` has a built-in 1NN Classifier for experimentation purposes. For more other use cases, all distance measure functions implemented can be used as customized cost function for models in `scikit-learn` library. The following code uses  ``lcss`` to classify time series in the ``Coffee`` dataset from the UCR archive.

```python3
>>> from tsdistance import OneNN
>>> model = OneNN(metric = 'lcss')
>>> model.fit(Coffee_train_X, Coffee_train_y)
>>> predicted_label = model.predict(Coffee_test_X)
>>> print('predicted_label: ', predicted_label)

>>> lb_predict:  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
```
