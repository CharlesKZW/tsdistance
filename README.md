  <h1><i>tsdistance</i>: time series distance measures</h1>
</div>

<!-- Short description -->
  tsdistance provides distance measures (a.k.a. metrics) suitable for various time series machine learning tasks, including classification, clustering, motif discovery, similarity search, etc. 
  
  For details, please see the [documentation](https://tsdistance.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Installation

from PyPi: ``python -m pip install tsdistance``

## Examples

### 1. Compute the distance between two time series


```python3
>>> from tsdistance.elastic import lcss
>>> import numpy as np
>>> X = np.array([3, 4, 38, 4, 5])
>>> Y = np.array([0, 3, 4])
>>> lcss_dist = lcss(X, Y, epsilon = 0.7)
>>> lcss_dist

>>> 0.33333333333333337
```


### 2. Use a distance measure in a machine learning model (e.g. classfication)

```python3
>>> from tsdistance import OneNN
>>> model = OneNN(metric = 'lcss')
>>> model.fit(Coffee_train_X, Coffee_train_y)
>>> predicted_label = model.predict(Coffee_test_X)
>>> print('predicted_label: ', predicted_label)

>>> lb_predict:  [0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
```
